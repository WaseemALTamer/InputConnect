Take full control of your digital workspace. InputConnect transforms any device into a natural extension of your main computer‚Äîseamlessly sharing your mouse, keyboard, clipboard, and audio across multiple devices.

With InputConnect, a second device feels just like adding another monitor:
- Stream audio across devices
- Use the same keyboard on multiple devices
- Control multiple devices with one mouse
- Copy and paste text effortlessly between devices


All of this works smoothly and naturally, allowing you to research, write documents, or play games as if you were using a second monitor.

It also helps reduce the load on your main device by seamlessly sharing tasks with another.

- To remove a connection, go to the **Links** tab, click the **trash/bin** icon, then confirm deletion.

- Once a connection is established, you can click the ‚Äú**X**‚Äù button ‚Äî the app will minimise to the system tray and continue running in the background.
